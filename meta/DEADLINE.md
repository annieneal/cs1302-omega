## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

I chose to do an arcade game for my final project. The game I chose to create is
a classic snake game. The user uses the arrow keys to move the snake, and attempts to eat as
many apples as possible. For each apple the snake eats, the score increases by one. The game
ends when the snake runs into one of the walls, or when it runs into itself.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Something new I learned while creating this that I really enjoyed was how to use the
javaFX GraphicsContext class. At first it seemed overwhelming, but as I worked with it
more and more it seemed to be a very useful tool for implementing this game.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I think I would have made it more visually appealing. Maybe add an actual snake head to
the head of the snake, or import images of apples rather than just filling circles.
